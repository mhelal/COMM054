    "Python has a wonderful function called map, which is sort of a basis for functional programming in the language. When you want to use map in Python, you pass it some function you want called, and some iterable, like a list, that you want the function to be applied to. The results are that the function is called against each item in the list, and there's a resulting list of all of the evaluations of that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a similar function called applymap. In applymap, you provide some function which should operate on each cell of a DataFrame, and the return set is itself a DataFrame. Now I think applymap is fine, but I actually rarely use it. Instead, I find myself often wanting to map across all of the rows in a DataFrame. And pandas has a function that I use heavily there, called apply. Let's look at an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take our census DataFrame. In this DataFrame, we have five columns for population estimates. Each column corresponding with one year of estimates. It's quite reasonable to want to create some new columns for minimum or maximum values, and the apply function is an easy way to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to write a function which takes in a particular row of data, finds a minimum and maximum values, and returns a new row of data. We'll call this function min_max, this is pretty straight forward. We can create some small slice of a row by projecting the population columns. Then use the NumPy min and max functions, and create a new series with a label values represent the new values we want to apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we just need to call apply on the DataFrame. Apply takes the function and the axis on which to operate as parameters. Now, we have to be a bit careful, we've talked about axis zero being the rows of the DataFrame in the past. But this parameter is really the parameter of the index to use. So, to apply across all rows, you pass axis equal to one. Of course there's no need to limit yourself to returning a new series object. If you're doing this as part of data cleaning your likely to find yourself wanting to add new data to the existing DataFrame. In that case you just take the row values and add in new columns indicating the max and minimum scores. This is a regular part of my workflow when bringing in data and building summary or descriptive statistics. And is often used heavily with the merging of DataFrames."

This is a bit of a fabricated example but lets say that you have a big batch job with lots of processing and you want to work on only a third or so of the states at a given time. We could create some function which returns a number between zero and two based on the first character of the state name. Then we can tell group by to use this function to split up our data frame. It's important to note that in order to do this you need to set the index of the data frame to be the column that you want to group by first."

If it's a capital Q we'll return a 1 and otherwise we'll return a 2. Then we'll pass this function to the data frame reply, and see that the data frame is segmented by the calculated group number. This kind of technique, which is sort of a light weight hashing, is commonly used to distribute tasks across multiple workers. Whether they are cores in a processor, nodes in a supercomputer, or disks in a database. A common work flow with group bias that you split your data, you apply some function, then you combine the results. This is called split apply combine pattern. "

This method applies a function to the column or columns of data in the group, and returns the results.With agg, you simply pass in a dictionary of the column names that you're interested in, and the function that you want to apply. For instance to build a summary data frame for the average populations per state, we could just give agg a dictionary with the Census 2010 pop key and the numb/pie average function."

    "Where the confusion can come in is when we change the labels of the dictionary we passed to aggregate, to correspond to the labels in our group data frame. In this case, pandas recognizes that they're the same and maps the functions directly to columns instead of creating a hierarchically labeled column. From my perspective this is very odd behavior, not what I would expect given the labeling change. So just be aware of this when using the aggregate function."

    "We've already seen that Pandas supports a number of different computational data types such as strings, integers and floating point numbers. What this doesn't capture is what we call the scale of the data.\n",
    "0:26\n",
    "Let's say that we have a data frame of students and their academic levels such as being in grade 1 or grade 2 and grade 3. There's a difference between a student in grade 1 and a student in grade 2, the same as the difference between a student in grade 8 and a student in grade 9. Well let's think about the final exam scores these students might get on assignments. Is the difference between an A and an A minus the same as the difference between an A minus and a B plus? At the University of Michigan at least, the answer is usually no.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've intuitively seen some different scales, and as we move through data cleaning and statistical analysis and machine learning, it's important to clarify our knowledge and terminology. As a data scientist there four scales that it's worth knowing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio Scale: In the ratio scale the measurements units are equally spaced and mathematical operations, such as subtract, division, and multiplication are all valid. Good examples of ratio scale measurements might be the height and weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next scale is the interval scale. In the interval scale the measurement units are equally spaced like the ratio scale. But there's no clear absence of value. That is there isn't a true zero, and so operation such as multiplication and division are not valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the interval scale might be the temperatures measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit. Since there's never an absence of temperature and 0 degrees is a meaningful value of temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next scale is the ordinal scale, and this is also important. In the ordinal scale the order of values is important but the differences between the values are not equally spaced. Here is a grading method that is used in many classes at the University of Michigan as a great example, where letter grades are given with pluses and minuses. But when you compare this to percentage values you see that a letter by itself covers 4% of the available grades and that a letter with a plus or minus is usually just 3% for the available grades. Based on this, it would be odd if there were as many students who received an A plus or A minus as there were who received a straight A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal data is very common in machine learning and can sometimes be a challenge to work with. The last scale I'll mention is the nominal scale which is often just called categorical data. Here the names of teams in a sport might be good example. There are a limited number of teams but changing their order or playing mathematical function to them is meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical values are very common and we generally refer to categories where there are only two possible values as binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example. Let's create a data frame of letter grades in the descending order. We can also set an index value of some more course grain measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when we instruct Pandas to render this as categorical data, we see that the D type has been set as category and that there are 11 different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to indicate to Pandas that this data is in a logical order, we pass the ordered equals true flag and we see those reflected in the category D type using the less than sign. What can you do with this? Well, ordinal data has ordering so it can help you with the Boolean masking. For instance, if we have our list of grades and we compared them with a C. If we did this lexographically, we would that a C+ and a C- are both actually greater than a C."
